Answer: Tax departments can collaborate internally to secure budget and ensure technology alignment by demonstrating their value to the company, explaining the impact of tax authority digitalization to the C-suite, and collaborating with the IT department. Creating a roadmap to utilize available technology, identifying future needs, and deciding whether to build or buy, all while maintaining a holistic view of the tax department's operating model are best practices. Companies adopting a top-down approach have seen more success in building this value case.
