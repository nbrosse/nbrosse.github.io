The **major histocompatibility complex** (**MHC**) is a large [locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics) "Locus (genetics)") on vertebrate DNA containing a set of closely linked [polymorphic genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_genes "Polymorphic genes") that code for [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") surface proteins essential for the [adaptive immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system "Adaptive immune system"). These cell surface proteins are called **MHC molecules**.

full function of MHC molecules: binding an [antigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen "Antigen") derived from self-proteins, or from pathogens, and bringing the antigen presentation to the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate [T-cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell "T cell").^[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#cite_note-2)^ MHC molecules mediate the interactions of [leukocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytes "Leukocytes"), also called [white blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cells "White blood cells") (WBCs), with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines donor compatibility for [organ transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplant "Organ transplant"), as well as one's susceptibility to [autoimmune diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease "Autoimmune disease").

In a cell, [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein") molecules of the host's own [phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype "Phenotype") or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule on the cell surface displays a small peptide (a molecular fraction of a protein) called an [epitope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope "Epitope").^[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#cite_note-3)^ The presented [self-antigens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_tolerance "Immune tolerance") prevent an [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism")'s [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system "Immune system") from targeting its own cells. The presentation of pathogen-derived proteins results in the elimination of the infected cell by the immune system.

Diversity of an individual's [self-antigen presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen_presentation "Antigen presentation"), mediated by MHC self-antigens, is attained in at least three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is [polygenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic "Polygenic") (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is [codominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codominant "Codominant") (from both sets of inherited [alleles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleles "Alleles")); (3) MHC [gene variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleles "Alleles") are highly [polymorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology) "Polymorphism (biology)") (diversely varying from organism to organism within a [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species")). Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide [splicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_splicing "Protein splicing"), which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.^[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#cite_note-6)^

The MHC locus is present in all [jawed vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostomata "Gnathostomata"); it is assumed to have arisen about 450 million years ago.^[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#cite_note-15)^ Despite the difference in the number of genes included in the MHC of different species, the overall organization of the locus is rather similar. Usual MHC contains about a hundred genes and pseudogenes, not all of them are involved in immunity. In [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human"), the MHC region occurs on [chromosome 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_6 "Chromosome 6"), and contains 224 genes spanning 3.6 mega[base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pairs "Base pairs") (3 600 000 bases).^[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#cite_note-MHCsc2-11)^ About half have known immune functions. The [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") MHC is also called the HLA ([human leukocyte antigen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen "Human leukocyte antigen")) complex (often just the HLA). Similarly, there is SLA (Swine leukocyte antigens), BoLA (Bovine leukocyte antigens), DLA for dogs, etc.

The MHC gene family is divided into three subgroups: [MHC class I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I "MHC class I"), [MHC class II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II "MHC class II"), and [MHC class III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_III "MHC class III"). Among all those genes present in MHC, there are two types of genes coding for the proteins [MHC class I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I "MHC class I") molecules and [MHC class II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II "MHC class II") molecules that are directly involved in the [antigen presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen_presentation "Antigen presentation"). These genes are highly polymorphic, 19031 alleles of class I HLA, and 7183 of class II HLA are deposited for human in the IMGT database.^[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex#cite_note-16)^
