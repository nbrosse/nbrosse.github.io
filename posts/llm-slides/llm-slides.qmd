categories: [LLM]
---

Creating effective slide decks is essential for communicating ideas in business, academia, and public speaking. Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in this process by saving time, improving clarity, and boosting creativity. They can generate content, suggest visualizations, and write speaker notes.

However, using LLMs to create slides — especially in Google Slides and PowerPoint — **is challenging**. Why is this the case ? **Can we create a better experience ?**

In this post, I will:

- Highlight why formats like HTML/CSS and Quarto/Reveal.js are better suited for LLM-powered slide decks.
- Share a comparison of the experience generating slides in different formats.

To provide a fair and practical comparison, I selected the first pages of a real-world presentation: the [EDF Producer Booklet (FET17CR)](livret_producteur_fet17cr_v1.1.pdf). I then prompted an LLM, using Google Gemini Pro 2.5, to replicate the first few pages of this presentation in several different formats:

- HTML/CSS
- Quarto/Reveal.js
- Google Slides
- PowerPoint

I evaluated the LLM's output based on:

- Fidelity: How closely does the result match the original slides?
- Ease of Generation: How straightforward is the prompt and output process?
- Editability: How easy is it to modify the generated slides?

Below, I present the results and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbrosse/llm-slide-deck), with a companion website [here](https://nbrosse.github.io/llm-slide-deck/) where you can view the rendered slides.

# How LLMs Can Help You Create Slides {#sec-llm-slides}

**1. Brainstorming and Outlining**

When you're starting a presentation, LLMs can be incredibly helpful for getting your ideas flowing. They can generate fresh ideas for your presentation topic, suggest logical structures and outlines that make sense, and help you identify the key points that will resonate most with your audience. For example, you might ask them to "Suggest an outline for a presentation on renewable energy trends in 2025" and get a well-structured framework to build upon.

**2. Drafting Slide Content**

Once you have your outline, LLMs excel at helping you fill in the content. They can write concise bullet points that capture the essence of complex topics, summarize lengthy information into digestible chunks, and rephrase technical jargon into language that your audience will understand. A simple prompt like "Summarize the main benefits of using LLMs in education in 3 bullet points" can give you exactly what you need for a slide.

**3. Visual Suggestions**

While LLMs can't create images directly, they're great at suggesting what types of visuals would work best for your content. They can recommend specific types of charts, diagrams, or images that would illustrate your points effectively, and offer guidance on slide layouts and design principles. You might ask "What kind of chart would best illustrate the growth of AI adoption from 2020 to 2025?" and get specific recommendations for the most appropriate visualization.

**4. Improving Clarity and Engagement**

LLMs can act as a second pair of eyes on your presentation, reviewing your slides for clarity and suggesting improvements. They can propose engaging questions or anecdotes that will help you connect with your audience, and help you tailor your language to match your audience's level of expertise. A prompt like "Rewrite this slide to be more engaging for a non-technical audience" can transform dry content into something that captures attention.

**5. Generating Speaker Notes**

One of the most valuable features LLMs offer is their ability to generate speaker notes that accompany each slide. They can draft detailed notes that help you elaborate on your bullet points during your talk, ensuring you don't miss important details while keeping your presentation flowing naturally. You could ask them to "Write speaker notes for a slide about the challenges of AI in healthcare" and get comprehensive talking points.

**6. Language and Translation Support**

LLMs can also help with language-related tasks, from translating your slide content into multiple languages to checking grammar and spelling. This is particularly useful if you're presenting to international audiences or want to ensure your presentation is polished and professional. A simple request like "Translate this slide into French" can instantly make your content accessible to a broader audience.

# Why Code-Based Formats Work Better with LLMs {#sec-why-code-based}

The fundamental reason why LLMs struggle with Google Slides and PowerPoint is that these tools are designed for human interaction through graphical interfaces, not for programmatic creation. LLMs work best when they can generate and manipulate text-based code, which is exactly what formats like Reveal.js, Quarto, and HTML/CSS provide.

When you ask an LLM to create a presentation in Google Slides or PowerPoint, it has to generate complex API calls or scripts that then manipulate the presentation through external interfaces. This creates multiple layers of abstraction and potential points of failure. The LLM isn't directly creating the presentation; it's creating code that creates the presentation.

In contrast, with Reveal.js and Quarto, the LLM can work directly with the source material. A Quarto presentation is essentially a Markdown file with some YAML configuration. When you ask an LLM to create a slide deck, it can generate the actual presentation content in a format that's both human-readable and machine-executable. The LLM's natural output—structured text—becomes the presentation itself, not just instructions for building one.

This direct approach eliminates the complexity of API authentication, object IDs, and the verbose syntax required by presentation software APIs. Instead, the LLM can focus on what it does best: generating clear, well-structured content that can be immediately rendered into a beautiful presentation.

The comparison below supports this remark by showing how LLMs perform when generating presentations in different formats. When tasked with creating a slide deck, LLMs consistently produce more accurate, editable, and reliable results in code-based formats like Quarto/Reveal.js or HTML/CSS, compared to GUI-based tools like Google Slides or PowerPoint.

# EDF Producer Booklet (FET17CR): Overview {#sec-edf-booklet}

Below is a preview of the first pages of the [EDF Producer Booklet (FET17CR)](livret_producteur_fet17cr_v1.1.pdf). This document provides essential information for energy producers, including operational guidelines, key contacts, and regulatory details. You can view the original PDF directly in your browser or download it for offline reference.

I prompt the LLM (Google Gemini Pro 2.5) to produce the slides in several formats, including Quarto/Reveal.js Markdown, pure HTML/CSS, and Google Slides API code. This allows me to compare how well the LLM handles each format in terms of fidelity, ease of generation, and editability.

# Building Slide Decks with Pure HTML & CSS {#sec-html-css}

Building Slide Decks with Pure HTML & CSS involves creating a single HTML file and styling it with CSS to behave like a presentation. When you create a slide deck using only HTML and CSS, you are responsible for every aspect of the presentation's structure, style, and interactivity. This approach offers maximum flexibility but requires significant manual effort.

**Pros:**

- Full control over every detail (layout, transitions, features).
- No dependencies—just HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript.
- Can be highly optimized for specific needs or branding.

**Cons:**

- Time-consuming: you must implement navigation, slide transitions, and features like speaker notes from scratch.
- No built-in support for advanced features (fragments, code highlighting, export to PDF, etc.).
- Harder to maintain and collaborate on, especially for large presentations.

**Structure (HTML):** 
You define each slide as an HTML element, typically a `<section>` or a `<div>`. The entire presentation is a container holding these slide elements.
```html
<body>
    <main id="presentation">
    <section class="slide active">
        <h1>My Presentation Title</h1>
        <p>By Me</p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
        <h2>Second Slide Topic</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Point 1</li>
        <li>Point 2</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <!-- more slides... -->
    </main>
</body>
```

**Styling (CSS):** 
You write CSS to make it look like a presentation. This is the most complex part.

- Hide all slides by default (`.slide { display: none; }`).
- Show only the current slide (`.slide.active { display: block; }`).
- Style the slides to take up the full screen, center content, set fonts, colors, backgrounds, etc.
- Create transitions between slides using CSS Transitions or Animations.

**Functionality (JavaScript):** 
You must write JavaScript from scratch to handle all logic:

- Listening for keyboard events (arrow keys) to navigate.
- Changing the `.active` class from the current slide to the next/previous one.
- Implementing a progress bar.
- Handling speaker notes in a separate window.
- Implementing any "fragment" animations (e.g., making bullet points appear one by one).

**Example on the EDF Producer Booklet**

The LLM was able to generate the HTML and CSS for the initial slides of the EDF Producer Booklet on the first attempt, with only minor issues. 
This highlights the LLM's effectiveness and consistency when producing HTML/CSS-based slide decks. 
However, navigation between slides and editing content remain cumbersome.

# Building Slide Decks with Quarto & Reveal.js {#sec-quarto-reveal}

Quarto and Reveal.js abstract away the low-level details, letting you focus on content rather than implementation.

**Pros:**

- Write slides in Markdown—simple, readable, and easy to maintain.
- Built-in support for themes, transitions, code highlighting, speaker notes, and more.
- Easy to add advanced features (math, interactive widgets, citations).
- Integrates with version control and reproducible research workflows.
- Output is a polished HTML presentation powered by Reveal.js.

**Cons:**

- Less granular control over the underlying HTML/CSS (though you can customize if needed).
- Requires installing Quarto and learning its configuration syntax.

I use two tools in tandem:

*   **Reveal.js:** A powerful, open-source HTML presentation framework. It provides the engine: the pre-built CSS for styling, the JavaScript for navigation, speaker notes, plugins, and all the features.
*   **Quarto:** A next-generation, open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It acts as an authoring tool. You write your content in a simple format (Quarto Markdown), and Quarto converts it into the complex HTML, CSS, and JS structure that Reveal.js requires.

Note that you can use Reveal.js without Quarto, but you need to write more code to get the same features.

**Authoring (Quarto Markdown - `.qmd`):** You create a single text file. You use simple Markdown for content and a YAML header for configuration.

```markdown
---
title: "My Presentation Title"
author: "By Me"
format: revealjs
theme: sky
---

## Second Slide Topic

- Point 1
- Point 2
```

**Rendering (Quarto CLI):** You run a single command in your terminal: `quarto render my_presentation.qmd`.

**Output:** Quarto takes your `.qmd` file, intelligently processes it, and generates a fully-functional `my_presentation.html` file. This file contains all your content correctly formatted, along with all the necessary Reveal.js CSS and JavaScript to make it a working, interactive slideshow.

**Example on the EDF Producer Booklet**

Quarto works seamlessly: you can open the generated HTML file in any browser and your presentation is immediately ready, with no dependencies or build steps required. LLMs are familiar with Quarto syntax and were able to generate the initial slides of the EDF Producer Booklet on the first attempt with minimal errors.
Additionally, editing content in the `.qmd` file is straightforward, and Quarto automatically updates the HTML output when you re-render.

# Summary Table: HTML & CSS vs. Quarto & Reveal.js {#sec-comparison-html-quarto}

| Feature / Aspect | HTML & CSS (from scratch) | Quarto & Reveal.js | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ease of Use & Learning Curve | Higher learning curve; requires knowledge of HTML, advanced CSS (Flexbox/Grid, animations), and JavaScript for interactivity. | Lower learning curve; content is authored in Markdown with minimal need for HTML/CSS/JS. | Quarto is simpler to start with; HTML/CSS provides direct control when needed. |
| Speed of Authoring | Typically slower; structure and styling are created manually. | Typically faster; content-first workflow with layout helpers. | Quarto often leads to quicker drafts; speed in HTML/CSS depends on templates and tooling. |
| Styling & Customization | Full design flexibility via CSS and JavaScript. | Theme-based customization with options to extend via CSS/SASS. | HTML/CSS maximizes flexibility; Quarto balances customization and simplicity. |
| Code & Syntax Highlighting | Requires integrating a highlighting library and adding appropriate markup. | Built-in syntax highlighting; optional executable code in supported languages. | Quarto reduces setup effort. |
| Math & Equations (LaTeX) | Requires integrating and configuring MathJax/KaTeX. | Built-in math rendering with LaTeX-style syntax. | Quarto simplifies configuration. |
| Speaker Notes | Custom implementation required for presenter view and syncing. | Built-in speaker view using notes blocks. | Presenter tools are included in Quarto by default. |
| Advanced Features | Implemented case-by-case (backgrounds, transitions, fragments, TOC, annotations). | Many features available via options or YAML configuration. | Quarto surfaces common features with minimal code. |
| Maintainability | Content and presentation can be intertwined; global changes handled in CSS. | Content and presentation are separated; themes control global style. | Separation can ease long-term maintenance; HTML/CSS offers precise control. |
| Output Formats | Generally targets HTML output. | Can render slides, PDF, Word, or web pages from the same source file. | Multi-format output supports varied publishing needs. |
| Collaboration | Larger templates can be harder to review; merge conflicts may occur in markup/CSS. | Markdown source is usually easier to review and version. | Plain-text workflows can simplify collaboration. |

The comparison between pure HTML/CSS and Quarto/Reveal.js is a classic case of **Control vs. Convenience**.

*   **HTML/CSS** gives you ultimate, low-level control at the cost of immense complexity, time, and required expertise. You are building the engine *and* the car.
*   **Quarto/Reveal.js** gives you a powerful, feature-rich engine out of the box and an incredibly simple, intuitive interface to put your content into it. You are focusing on the journey, not on mechanical engineering.

While the "from scratch" method is a valid (and sometimes necessary) approach for highly specialized design work, the **Quarto and Reveal.js workflow is overwhelmingly superior for almost every practical use case.** It is faster, easier, more maintainable, and comes packed with features that are critical for modern technical and academic presentations.

# Building Slide Decks with Google Slides API {#sec-google-slides-api}

There are two primary ways to interact with Google Slides programmatically: the Google Slides API and Google Apps Script. Both methods allow you to create, read, and update presentations, but they differ significantly in their approach and capabilities.

1.  **The Google Slides API:** The official, robust, and recommended method for external applications.
2.  **Google Apps Script:** The integrated, "inside-the-box" method for automation within the Google Workspace ecosystem.

## Method 1: The Google Slides API

This is the standard, modern way for an external program (e.g., a Python script on your server, a Node.js web app) to talk to Google Slides. It's a RESTful API, meaning your code makes HTTP requests to Google's servers to perform actions.

**How it Works:**

1.  Setup: You must first set up a project in the Google Cloud Console.
2.  Authentication: You enable the "Google Slides API" for your project and create credentials. This is the most complex part. You'll typically use either:
    *   OAuth 2.0: For applications where a user logs in and grants your app permission to manage their slides.
    *   Service Account: For backend applications that act on their own behalf (e.g., a nightly script that generates a report). This is common for automation.
3.  Code: You use a Google-provided client library (available for Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, etc.) or make raw HTTP requests to send commands. All operations are typically sent in a `batchUpdate` request, which bundles multiple changes into a single API call for efficiency.

**Key Capabilities:**

*   Create/Read Presentations: Create blank presentations or read the entire structure of an existing one.
*   Manage Slides: Add new slides (with predefined layouts), delete slides, duplicate slides, and reorder them.
*   Manipulate Shapes & Text: Insert new text boxes, shapes, images, and tables. You can precisely control their size, position, and styling (font, color, fill, etc.).
*   Data Merging: You can create a template presentation with placeholder text like `{{customer_name}}` or `{{quarterly_revenue}}`. Your code can then find and replace these placeholders with actual data, generating hundreds of custom decks from a single template.
*   Read Speaker Notes: Programmatically get or set the speaker notes for any slide.

**Pros:**

*   Robust & Scalable: Built for heavy, programmatic use.
*   Language Agnostic: Works with any language that can make HTTP requests. Official libraries make it easy.
*   Powerful Data Integration: The best method for data-driven slide generation (e.g., from a database or a CSV file).
*   Secure: Uses industry-standard authentication (OAuth 2.0).

**Cons:**

*   Complex Initial Setup: The Google Cloud Console and authentication flow can be intimidating for beginners.
*   Verbose: Requests can be complex JSON objects. A simple action like "insert text" requires specifying object IDs, locations, etc.
*   Cannot Automate Everything: It cannot interact with the UI, click buttons, or use third-party add-ons. It only works with what the API exposes.

**Example Use Case (Python):** Example of how to create a new presentation and add a title slide.

```python
# Assumes you have set up credentials and have 'credentials.json'
# pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# --- Authentication ---
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations']
creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES) # Handle auth flow
service = build('slides', 'v1', credentials=creds)

# --- Create a new Presentation ---
body = {'title': 'Automated Weekly Report'}
presentation = service.presentations().create(body=body).execute()
presentation_id = presentation.get('presentationId')
print(f"Created presentation with ID: {presentation_id}")

# --- Add a Title Slide (assuming the first slide exists and is a title slide) ---
requests = [
    {
        'insertText': {
            'objectId': 'your_title_object_id', # You'd need to find this ID first
            'text': 'Weekly Sales Performance',
            'insertionIndex': 0
        }
    },
    {
        'insertText': {
            'objectId': 'your_subtitle_object_id', # Or get it from the slide layout
            'text': 'Data from week ending 2023-10-27',
            'insertionIndex': 0
        }
    }
]

# --- Execute the batch update ---
body = {'requests': requests}
service.presentations().batchUpdate(presentationId=presentation_id, body=body).execute()
```

## Method 2: Google Apps Script

This is a server-side JavaScript platform that lives *inside* your Google account. You write code in a browser-based IDE, and it can be attached to a specific Google Doc/Sheet/Slide or run as a standalone project.

**How it Works:**
You open a Google Slides presentation, go to `Extensions > Apps Script`, and start writing JavaScript code. The code uses services like `SlidesApp`, `SpreadsheetApp`, and `GmailApp` to interact with Google products. It feels more like writing macros than interacting with a remote API.

**Key Capabilities:**

*   Everything the Slides API can do, but with a simpler, more object-oriented syntax.
*   Create Custom Menus: Add your own menus to the Google Slides UI to trigger your scripts.
*   Triggers: Run scripts automatically on a timer (e.g., every morning), when a form is submitted, or when the presentation is opened (`onOpen`).
*   Seamless Integration: Effortlessly pull data from Google Sheets, create slides, and then email a PDF of the presentation using Gmail, all in one script.

**Pros:**

*   Zero Setup: No cloud console, no complex authentication. You just start writing code.
*   Extremely Easy to Learn: The syntax is much more direct and intuitive than the API.
*   Perfect for Internal Automation: Ideal for tasks within the Google Workspace ecosystem (e.g., "Generate slides from this Google Sheet").
*   Can create simple UI elements (menus, sidebars, dialogs).

**Cons:**

*   JavaScript Only: You are locked into the Google-flavored JavaScript environment.
*   Not for External Apps: It's difficult to call an Apps Script from an external, non-Google application (though possible via the Apps Script API or as a Web App).
*   Execution Limits: Scripts have maximum runtimes (e.g., 6 minutes for a consumer account) and daily quotas.

**Example Use Case:** Add a custom menu item "Create Summary Slide" that reads data from a specific Google Sheet and generates a new slide.

```javascript
// This code is written in the Apps Script editor attached to a presentation.

function onOpen() {
  // Add a custom menu to the UI when the presentation is opened.
  SlidesApp.getUi()
      .createMenu('Automation')
      .addItem('Generate Summary Slide', 'createSummarySlide')
      .addToUi();
}

function createSummarySlide() {
  const presentation = SlidesApp.getActivePresentation();
  const spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById('your_spreadsheet_id_here');
  const sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName('SalesData');
  
  // Get data from a cell in Google Sheets
  const totalRevenue = sheet.getRange('B2').getValue();
  const topProduct = sheet.getRange('B5').getValue();

  // Add a new slide to the presentation
  const slide = presentation.appendSlide(SlidesApp.PredefinedLayout.TITLE_AND_BODY);
  
  // Populate the new slide
  slide.getShapes().find(s => s.isPlaceholder() && s.getPlaceholderType() == SlidesApp.PlaceholderType.TITLE).getText().setText('Sales Summary');
  slide.getShapes().find(s => s.isPlaceholder() && s.getPlaceholderType() == SlidesApp.PlaceholderType.BODY).getText().setText(`Total Revenue: $${totalRevenue}\nTop Product: ${topProduct}`);
}
```

## Summary Comparison Table

| Feature | Google Slides API | Google Apps Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use Case** | Backend services, data-driven generation | Internal automation within Google Workspace |
| **Robustness** | **High.** Official, stable interface. | **High.** Stable internal interface. |
| **Ease of Setup** | **Hard.** Requires Google Cloud project & OAuth. | **Very Easy.** No setup required. |
| **Language Support** | Any (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.) | JavaScript only |
| **Performance** | Fast and efficient. | Fast, but with execution time limits. |
| **Integration** | Excellent for external systems (databases, etc.) | Excellent for internal G Suite apps (Sheets, Gmail) |
| **Recommendation** | **The standard choice for most programmatic work.** | **The best choice for quick, internal G Suite tasks.** |

## Example on the EDF Producer Booklet

This section focuses on the Google Slides API, which offers the most flexible approach to programmatic slide creation.
The complete implementation code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbrosse/llm-slide-deck/blob/main/google/create_slides.py).

Using Google Gemini Pro 2.5, I generated code to create the initial slides of the EDF Producer Booklet. The development process encountered multiple errors and required extensive trial-and-error iterations, along with substantial manual adjustments to produce functional code. The final implementation, while working, lacks readability and would be challenging to maintain or modify.

Here is the rendered slides:

# Building Slide Decks with Microsoft PowerPoint {#sec-microsoft-powerpoint}

Unlike Google Slides, PowerPoint file creation offers more diverse approaches due to the `.pptx` format being an open, well-documented, XML-based standard (Office Open XML or OOXML). The format essentially consists of a ZIP archive containing XML files and associated resources.

## The Powerful, Offline Way: Third-Party Libraries

This is the most common and practical approach for server-side generation. These libraries provide a high-level API to abstract away the complexity of the underlying OOXML format.

*   **Python: `python-pptx`**
    *   The de facto standard in the Python world. It lets you create and modify `.pptx` files without needing PowerPoint installed.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        from pptx import Presentation
        from pptx.util import Inches

        prs = Presentation()
        title_slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[0] # Title Slide layout
        slide = prs.slides.add_slide(title_slide_layout)
        title = slide.shapes.title
        subtitle = slide.placeholders[1]

        title.text = "Hello, from Python!"
        subtitle.text = "Created with python-pptx"

        prs.save("report.pptx")
        ```

*   **JavaScript/Node.js: `pptxgenjs`**
    *   An excellent, feature-rich library that works in both Node.js and the browser. It has a fluent API and extensive documentation.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        const pptxgen = require("pptxgenjs");

        let pptx = new pptxgen();
        let slide = pptx.addSlide();

        slide.addText("Hello from Node.js!", {
          x: 1, y: 1, w: '80%', h: 1, fontSize: 36, fill: { color: '003366' }
        });

        pptx.writeFile({ fileName: "report.pptx" });
        ```

*   **Java: Apache POI**
    *   A mature, robust library from the Apache Software Foundation for working with Microsoft Office formats. The component for PowerPoint is `XSLF` (for `.pptx`). It's powerful but can be more verbose than its Python/JS counterparts.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**
        ```java
        XMLSlideShow ppt = new XMLSlideShow();
        XSLFSlideMaster defaultMaster = ppt.getSlideMasters().get(0);
        XSLFSlideLayout titleLayout = defaultMaster.getLayout(SlideLayout.TITLE);
        XSLFSlide slide = ppt.createSlide(titleLayout);

        XSLFTextShape title = slide.getPlaceholder(0);
        title.setText("Hello from Java!");

        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("report.pptx");
        ppt.write(out);
        out.close();
        ```

## The Low-Level Way: Office Open XML (OOXML) SDK

This is a .NET library directly from Microsoft. It allows for the most granular control but is also the most complex. You are essentially manipulating the raw XML parts of the `.pptx` package.

*   **How it Works:** You programmatically create and relate XML parts like `slide1.xml`, `presentation.xml`, `theme1.xml`, etc.
*   **Use Case:** When a third-party library doesn't support a specific, advanced feature you need, or when you are in a strict .NET environment and want maximum performance.
*   **Language:** .NET (C#, F#, VB.NET).

## The Modern, Cloud-Native Way: Microsoft Graph API

This is Microsoft's unified API for all Microsoft 365 services, including OneDrive, where PowerPoint files are stored. It is the cloud equivalent of the Google Slides API.

*   **How it Works:** You make RESTful API calls to the Graph endpoint. Its capabilities for *creating slide content* are still maturing and are not yet as comprehensive as libraries like `python-pptx`. It's often used to manage files (upload, download, copy) that were generated by other means.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Create a blank presentation in OneDrive or SharePoint.
    *   *Limited* ability to add slides and basic content.
    *   Powerful for file management and integration with the M365 ecosystem.

## The Classic Automation Way: VBA and Office Add-ins

This method requires the PowerPoint application to be running. It's for automating the application itself, not for server-side file generation.

*   **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications):** The legacy scripting language built into Office applications. You can write macros to create slides, insert objects, and control every aspect of the UI.
*   **Office Add-ins (Office.js):** The modern replacement for VBA. You use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a web-based task pane inside PowerPoint that can interact with the presentation document.

## Example on the EDF Producer Booklet

The complete code example is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbrosse/llm-slide-deck/blob/main/powerpoint/create_powerpoint_slides.py).
This section examines the `python-pptx` library, a widely-adopted and well-documented solution for programmatic PowerPoint generation.

Similar to the Google Slides approach, Google Gemini Pro 2.5 successfully generated code to create the initial slides of the EDF Producer Booklet using the `python-pptx` library. However, the output quality and visual fidelity proved disappointing. The generated code also suffered from poor readability and would be difficult to maintain. The rendered slides are displayed below:

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

## Comparison: Quarto/reveal.js vs. Google Slides vs. PowerPoint

This table compares the three approaches from a developer's perspective.

| Feature | Quarto / reveal.js | Google Slides API | PowerPoint (Office Scripts) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Paradigm** | **Code-First**. You write markdown/code, which renders into a presentation. The source is human-readable text. | **GUI-First, API-Enabled**. Users primarily use the web interface. The API automates tasks on top of that interface. | **GUI-First, API-Enabled**. The desktop/web app is primary. Scripts automate actions within it. |
| **Language** | **Markdown**. Can embed code from Python, R, Julia, etc., to generate content dynamically. | **REST API**. Use any language (Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.) with official client libraries. | **TypeScript**. Office Scripts are written exclusively in a subset of TypeScript. |
| **Setup & Auth** | **Simple**. Install Quarto. No API keys or authentication needed for local development. | **Complex**. Requires a Google Cloud Project, enabling the Slides API, and setting up OAuth 2.0 or a Service Account for authentication. | **Simple**. Requires a Microsoft 365 Business subscription. No setup needed, just open PowerPoint for the web and click "Automate". |
| **Version Control** | **Excellent**. The `.qmd` source file is plain text, perfect for Git. Tracking changes is easy and meaningful. | **Poor**. The underlying presentation is a binary-like format. You can version your *script*, but not the presentation itself. | **Poor**. Same as Google Slides. The `.pptx` is a complex file format. You can version control your script. |
| **Collaboration** | **Developer-centric**. Excellent for developers using Git, pull requests, etc. Not great for non-technical users to edit. | **Excellent**. The best for real-time, simultaneous editing by multiple users in the GUI. | **Very Good**. Real-time collaboration is supported in Microsoft 365, but generally considered slightly behind Google's implementation. |
| **Best For...** | Technical presentations, reproducible reports, data-driven slides, and anyone who prefers a "code-as-documentation" workflow. | Business presentations that need a mix of real-time collaboration and automation (e.g., auto-generating weekly reports from a database). | Corporate environments heavily invested in the Microsoft ecosystem. Good for automating repetitive tasks for business users. |

### Part 1: The Best Channel for Interaction

The "channel" is the user interface and experience through which the user collaborates with the LLM. The ideal channel should make it easy for the user to convey their intent and for the LLM to deliver useful, editable results.

Here are the possibilities, from simplest to most advanced:

#### 1. The Simple Conversational Chat (e.g., ChatGPT Interface)

This is the most common way people interact with LLMs today. The user provides a series of text prompts.

*   **How it Works:**
    *   **User:** "Create a 5-slide presentation for a Q3 business review. The first slide should be the title. The second should cover key wins. The third should cover challenges. The fourth, our Q4 goals. And the fifth, a Q&A slide."
    *   **LLM:** *Responds with a text-based outline, often using Markdown.*
    ```markdown
    **Slide 1: Title**
    - Title: Q3 2023 Business Review
    - Subtitle: Driving Growth & Facing Challenges

    **Slide 2: Key Wins**
    - Exceeded sales target by 15%
    - Launched new 'Project Phoenix' feature
    - Customer satisfaction score up 5 points
    ...and so on.
    ```
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Extremely Accessible:** No learning curve beyond typing.
    *   **Great for Brainstorming:** Excellent for generating initial outlines, ideas, and raw text content.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **High Friction for Creation:** The user must manually copy and paste this text into their presentation tool (PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.).
    *   **No Visual Context:** The LLM has no idea what the slides actually *look like*. You can't say "Make that title bigger" or "Put the image on the right."
    *   **Unstructured:** The conversation can become long and confusing. Keeping track of edits is difficult.

**Verdict:** Good for initial ideation and content generation, but a poor channel for building a complete, polished deck.

#### 2. The Programmatic/Code-Based Channel

This involves writing a script (e.g., in Python) that calls an LLM API to generate content and then uses another library to build the slide deck file.

*   **How it Works:**
    1.  A developer writes a script.
    2.  The script defines a template and prompts, e.g., "Generate 3 bullet points about the benefits of solar energy."
    3.  The script sends this prompt to the LLM API (e.g., OpenAI's API).
    4.  The LLM returns structured data (like a JSON object).
    5.  The script parses this data and uses a library like `python-pptx` or `Quarto` to programmatically build the slide deck.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Extremely Powerful & Scalable:** Perfect for automatically generating hundreds of data-driven presentations (e.g., a custom report for every client).
    *   **Reproducible:** The same script will produce a consistent result every time.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Requires Coding Skills:** Completely inaccessible to the average user.
    *   **Not Interactive:** It's an automation script, not a creative collaboration.

**Verdict:** The best channel for developers doing large-scale, automated slide generation. Not a channel for interactive, one-off creation.

#### 3. The Dedicated, Interactive UI (The "Holy Grail")

This is the ideal channel and what tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot (for PowerPoint) and various startups are building.

*   **How it Works:** Imagine a presentation application with an integrated LLM assistant.
    *   **A "Create" Pane:** The user gives a high-level prompt: "Create a 10-slide deck about the history of space exploration." The application generates a full draft with text and placeholder images.
    *   **Context-Aware Chat:** A chat sidebar is always present. The user can type commands *relative to the current view*.
        *   While on slide 4: "Summarize this text into three bullet points."
        *   While an image is selected: "Find me a different picture, something more dramatic."
        *   "Change the tone of this entire presentation to be more formal."
    *   **UI + LLM Synergy:** The user can still use the traditional UI (drag-and-drop, format painter) and the LLM assistant interchangeably.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Best of All Worlds:** Combines the intuitive power of conversational AI with the direct manipulation and visual feedback of a GUI.
    *   **Reduces Friction to Zero:** The gap between intent ("I want a slide about...") and creation is minimized.
    *   **Context is King:** The LLM's awareness of the current slide, selected objects, and overall theme makes its assistance far more relevant and powerful.

**Verdict:** **This is unequivocally the best channel.** It provides a tight feedback loop between the user's idea, the LLM's generation, and the final visual product.

### Part 2: The Best Output Format

Now, let's analyze the formats. The "best" format is the one that is **easiest for an LLM to generate reliably and programmatically**, while still being useful to the end-user.

#### 1. PowerPoint (.pptx) & Google Slides (via API)

These are proprietary/complex formats. An LLM cannot "write" a `.pptx` file directly. It must generate *code* that then builds the file.

*   **How Generation Works:** The LLM is prompted to write a script (e.g., Python using `python-pptx` or Google Apps Script). This script contains commands like `slide.add_textbox()`, `shape.text = '...'`, etc.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **User Familiarity:** This is the greatest strength. The final output is in the format that 99% of business users know and expect.
    *   **Ecosystem:** Fully integrated with corporate workflows, templates, and sharing mechanisms.
*   **Weaknesses (from an LLM perspective):**
    *   **Indirect Generation:** This is the critical flaw. The LLM isn't creating the deck; it's creating *code that creates the deck*. This adds a significant layer of complexity and potential for error. The generated code might have bugs.
    *   **High Barrier for Users:** If the channel is a simple chat, the user is given a Python script. They then need to have Python installed, install the right libraries, and run the script. This is a non-starter for most.
    *   **Verbose & Complex APIs:** The APIs for controlling these formats can be very detailed and verbose. It's much harder for an LLM to reliably generate a complex Google Slides `batchUpdate` JSON request than simple Markdown.

#### 2. Reveal.js (via Markdown/Quarto)

This is a fundamentally different approach. Reveal.js presentations are HTML/CSS/JS, but they are most often *authored* in a simple text-based format like Markdown.

*   **How Generation Works:** The LLM is prompted to write the content directly in Markdown.
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "A Presentation by an LLM"
    format: revealjs
    theme: sky
    ---

    ## Slide 2: The Core Idea
    - LLMs are excellent at generating structured text.
    - Markdown is structured text.
    - Therefore, LLMs can easily generate the source for a slide deck.

    ## Slide 3: How it Works
    A simple command like `quarto render` turns this human-readable file into a beautiful, interactive HTML presentation.
    ```
*   **Strengths (from an LLM perspective):**
    *   **Direct Generation:** **This is the killer feature.** The LLM's natural output format (structured text) is the *source code* for the presentation. There is no intermediate, error-prone code generation step.
    *   **Simplicity & Readability:** The format is incredibly simple and human-readable. It's trivial for an LLM to generate and for a human to edit.
    *   **Powerful Features, Simple Syntax:** Advanced features like speaker notes, columns, fragments, and themes are controlled by simple, text-based syntax that an LLM can easily learn and replicate.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **User Unfamiliarity:** Most users are not familiar with the Markdown-to-slides workflow.
    *   **Requires a Rendering Step:** The user needs to run a command (like `quarto render`) or use an editor with a render button (like VS Code or RStudio) to see the final output. This is a small but real hurdle.

### Conclusion and Final Recommendation

1.  **The Ultimate Vision (The Best Combination):**
    *   **Channel:** A **Dedicated, Interactive UI** similar to what Microsoft is building with Copilot.
    *   **Backend Format:** The application would use the LLM to generate **Markdown/Quarto code** behind the scenes because it's the most reliable and direct method.
    *   **Final Output:** The application would then automatically render this Markdown to Reveal.js for a live preview, but critically, it would *also* have an "**Export to PowerPoint**" button. This export function would parse the Markdown and use a library (`python-pptx`) to generate the `.pptx` file, giving the user the format they need for corporate distribution.

2.  **The Best Combination You Can Build *Today*:**
    *   **Channel:** A **conversational chat** (like the ChatGPT interface or a custom app using its API).
    *   **Format:** Ask the LLM to generate the presentation in **Quarto Markdown for Reveal.js**.

**Why is this the best practical choice right now?** Because it plays directly to the strengths of the LLM. You are asking the LLM to do what it does best: generate clean, structured text. The user's only task is to copy this text into a `.qmd` file and run a single command. This workflow has the lowest chance of generative error and produces a high-quality, modern, and feature-rich presentation. While it requires a small learning step for the user, it is far more reliable than asking the LLM to write complex Python or Apps Script code that the user would then have to debug and execute.
