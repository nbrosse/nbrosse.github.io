  title = {A Visual Dive into Conditional Flow Matching},
  abstract = {Conditional flow matching (CFM) was introduced by three simultaneous papers at ICLR 2023, through different approaches (conditional matching, rectifying flows and stochastic interpolants). <br/> The main part of this post, Section 2, explains CFM by using both visual intuitions and insights on its probabilistic formulations. Section 1 introduces nomalizing flows; it can be skipped by reader familiar with the topic, or that wants to cover them later. Section 3 opens on the links between CFM and other approaches, and ends with a 'CFM playground'.},
