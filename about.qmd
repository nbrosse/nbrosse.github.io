**Why I Write**

Welcome to my blog, a personal space where I share notes on my work and explorations in science, machine learning, and the broader tech landscape. These posts serve as a journal for my thoughts and discoveries, but I hope they also provide value and inspiration to anyone interested in these dynamic fields. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious, I invite you to explore and engage with the ideas I present here. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on exciting projects !

If you find my work interesting, please consider citing it in your research.

**Short Bio**

I am an AI Research Scientist working at the intersection of academic research and industry. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at CREST, supervised by Arnak Dalalyan, where my research focuses on generative modeling, with particular interest in diffusion models and flow matching. This work builds on a PhD in statistics and over six years of experience in data science and artificial intelligence.

My career spans both applied research and real-world deployment. I began at Thales, working on time series analysis, signal processing, object detection, and anomaly detection. I later joined Iktos, where I designed deep learning models for drug discovery, before contributing to foundational biological models at MBZUAI and GenBio AI.

In parallel with research, I maintain strong ties to industry and entrepreneurship. In 2025, I explored venture creation by developing proofs of concept for AI-driven decision-making tools, while freelancing on projects ranging from LLM observability platforms (Rollstack) to improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems (Clarifeye). I am driven by the challenge of translating cutting-edge theory into impactful, scalable AI systems.
